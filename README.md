# Deep-Learning-CSCE-636-Final-Project

To train our Wide Resnet Attention model  
1] Download all the files and CIFAR-10 dataset  
2] Run `python main.py --mode train`.  
3] Hyperparameters can be changed, such as epochs or batch size, from the `Configure.py` file.

To test our Wide Resnet Attention model on a public dataset:

1] Download all the files and ensure that the trained model weights are present in the `saved_models` folder.  
2] Run `python main.py --mode test`.

On the public test dataset of CIFAR-10, we have achieved an accuracy of 95.73%.

The model weights can be downloaded from the following link:
