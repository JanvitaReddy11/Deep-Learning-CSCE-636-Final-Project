# Deep-Learning-CSCE-636-Final-Project

To train our Wide Resnet Attention model
1] Download all the files and CIFAR-10 dataset
2] Run python main.py -- mode train.
3] Hyper parameters can be changed such as epochs or batch size from the Configure.py file


To test our Wide Resnet Attention model on public dataset

1] Download all the files and in the repository
2] Ensure that in saved_models folder the trained model weights are present 
3] Run python main.py --mode test

On the public test dataset of CIFAR-10 we have achieved an accuracy of 95.73%

The model weights can be downloaded from
